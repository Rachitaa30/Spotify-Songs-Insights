Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
Extract track details (artist, genre, release year, features) from Spotify API
Download dataset for additional features

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handle missing values
Normalize units (duration to minutes, loudness scale, etc.)

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature distributions (tempo, energy, danceability)
Top artists by popularity
Genre-wise audio feature profile
Trends by year

4. Correlation & Statistical Insights
Correlation heatmap
Popularity vs. tempo, loudness, valence

5.Visualization
Line charts for trends
Scatter plots for relationships
Bar charts for artists & genre analysisProject Workflow

Future Improvements
Build ML model to predict song popularity
Create interactive dashboard (Power BI / Tableau / Plotly Dash)
Deploy a web app recommending songs based on audio features
